# Landing-Page
A paid project I did for a company in Russia


The way to install and actually see the Landing Page I have created.

Steps:

 
1. Download the folder and open it.

2. Two files with endings .html, .css are source codes. Rest of the files are pictures and icons to allow the page to work correctly.

3. Open file ending with .html and press two times to view it in the browser. Otherwise open with Sublime Text or any other text editor to see the source code
